Some documents, sites and resources about automata

# E.1 Contemporary Automata

Web resources that focus on contemporaryautomata. Many of these offer support to teachers using automata in the classroom:

- [Automata and Mechanical Toys](http://automata.co.uk/) - A source for information on constructing automata with a focus on their use in education in the United Kingdom. Interactive CDs and some excellent books are offered for
sale.
- [Cabaret Mechanical Theatre](http://www.cabaret.co.uk) - CMT is an excellent jumping off point for the budding automatist, from short biographies of some of the Cabaret artists to support for automata in education to virtual gallery exhibits. The online shop sells a variety of kits, books, videos, and professionally constructed automata.
- [Chomick and Meder - Figurative Art and Automata](http://www.chomickmeder.com/) - A blending of contemporary automata sensibilities with golden age appearance.
- [Flying Pig](http://www.flying-pig.co.uk/) - Similar to the Cabaret website in structure, it offers a complementary mix of educational material and automata kits.


# E.2 Automata Builders
A sampling of artists whose primary medium is automata in all of its variations:

- [Dug North](http://www.dugnorth.com/index.asp) - Handmade wooden automata
- [Fourteen Balls Toy Company](http://www.fourteenballstoy.co.uk) - A collaboration of Paul Spooner and Matt Smith, both CMT artists
- [Francois Junod](http://people.timezone.com/mdisher/decorte/junod/junodpart1.htm) - Large scale automata with intricate mechanisms.
- [Keith Newstead](http://www.keithnewsteadautomata.com/) - The personal automata site of one of the CMT artists.
- [Martin Smith](http://www.smithautomata.co.uk) - Automata and mechanical sculptures.
- [Walter Ruffler](http://www.walterruffler.de/index1.html) - Paper and card automata and kits.
- Rodney Peppe -  To call Rodney’s work “moving toys” is to do him a disservice. His book [Automata and Mechanical Toys (ISBN 1-86126-510-7)](https://www.amazon.it/Automata-Mechanical-Toys-Rodney-Peppe/dp/1861265107) should be in the library of every automata
builder
